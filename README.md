Twitter feeling investigation is performed to distinguish the opinions of individuals towards different points. For this undertaking, I dissected the opinion of individuals towards Pfizer antibodies. I utilized the information accessible on Kaggle to make this AI model. The gathered tweets from Twitter were dissected utilizing AI to distinguish the various opinions present in the tweets. The various opinions distinguished in this venture incorporate positive feeling, pessimistic feeling and unbiased feeling. I utilized various classifiers to see which classifier gives the best model precision.
